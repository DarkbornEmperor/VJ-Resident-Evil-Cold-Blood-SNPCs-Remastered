# [VJ] Resident Evil: Cold Blood SNPCs
Adds enemies from the HL1 mod, Resident Evil: Cold Blood for Garry's Mod. The HL1 mod was created by Team Psykskallar. 
 
This addon was initially released back in 2019 but I never had the time or motivation to finish it due to my lackluster knowledge back in the day. But now that it's been remastered from the ground up, it's back and far better with much more content and quality of life improvements.

Credits go to Dopey for allowing me to use his RE particles.
